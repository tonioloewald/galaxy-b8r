# galaxy-b8r

This is a procedural galaxy generator that was created to test algorithms for
my never-to-be-completed [projectweasel](https://projectweasel.com/). The goal
is not realism, but to create interesting and varied content.

See it working via [rawgit](https://rawgit.com/tonioloewald/galaxy-b8r/master/)
