# galaxy-b8r

This is a procedural galaxy generator that was created to test algorithms for
my never-to-be-completed [projectweasel](http://projectweasel.com/). The goal
is not realism, but to create interesting and varied content.

More recently, I modified it to use [b8r](https://bindinator.com) to manage 
the user interface bindings since it's both interesting and generates a lot
of data without requiring a back-end.

See it working via [rawgit](https://rawgit.com/tonioloewald/galaxy-b8r/master/)
